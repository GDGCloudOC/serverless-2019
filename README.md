# Serverless GCP in 2019

This repo contains the demonstration code that was used for [GDGCloudOC](https://meetup.com/gdgcloudoc) meeting in May.

The `nodejs-functions-framework` folder has the source code used to demo Functions Framework with NodeJS 10 on Cloud Functions, Cloud Run and Cloud Run on GKE.

The folder `foundations` contains Terraform to create the project used for the demonstration, and will need modification before it can be used outside of Neudesic.
